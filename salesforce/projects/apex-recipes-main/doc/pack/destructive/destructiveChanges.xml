# To delete components
# use the same procedure as with deploying components
# but also include a delete manifest file 
# thatâ€™s named destructiveChanges.xml 
# and list the components to delete in this manifest.

# To deploy the destructive changes
# you must also have a package.xml 
# file that lists no components to deploy, 
# includes the API version, 
# and is in the same directory as destructiveChanges.xml
